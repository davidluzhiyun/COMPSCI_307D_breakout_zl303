### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:
1. Sees the ball as a single point.
   1. Which implies we are ignoring the case where the ball hits the corner
   of a brick.
   2. Ignore the case where multiple bricks are hit at the same time
2. Frame rate is high enough so that the ball doesn't go much into or through bricks
between frames


Known Bugs:
1. If the ball hit close to the corner of bricks at a high enough speed, the 
collision might not be correctly processed.
